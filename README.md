# My Bookshelf

## Description
This is a full stack application using Google Books API and a MySQL database that allows the user to search for books by author or keyword/title.  Users can also create an account all CRUD operations are used to allow users to save books, mark them as 'read' or 'unread', favorite books, and remove books from their account.  On their "My Books" page, they can view any books they have saved and can also filter those books by author.
